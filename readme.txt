# FileSystem Watcher Project

## Iteration 2

Tairan initiated the code base by using the UML that I architected. I put careful thought into how each class would interact, which gave us a clear direction for implementation. He began writing the FileEvent, QueryCriteria, and Main classes using the structure I laid out. Meanwhile, I focused on completing the SRS document, making sure it reflected the actual code and stayed consistent with our system design. I updated the requirements to match how the program was evolving, and I made sure the technical descriptions were aligned with the implementation. We faced some challenges with the UML. It was not just about adding arrows or shapes, but making sure the relationships made sense and reflected what the system was actually doing. I had to be precise with things like visibility, class responsibilities, and how the different parts connected. Even though it took time, it helped us think through the architecture more deeply and made our development process more focused.
