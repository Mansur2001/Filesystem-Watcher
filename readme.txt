# FileSystem Watcher Project

## Overview

This is a desktop application built for monitoring file system events (create, modify, rename, delete) for specific file types using a GUI. 
The system can log changes and optionally store them into a SQLite database for further querying and historical record-keeping.

This project was developed for an academic assignment to demonstrate:
- GUI construction
- File system monitoring with Watchdog (Python) / WatchService (Java) / FileSystemWatcher (.NET)
- SQLite database integration
- Real-time user interaction


## Requirements
- C# + FileSystemWatcher + SQLite.NET
