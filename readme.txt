# FileSystem Watcher Project

## Iteration 1

This week, we encountered several challenges while working on our coding tasks and the filesystem project. 
Creating the UML diagram was a hurdle because we had to make sure that the designing and format were accurate.
We followed proper notation (like visibility markers, relationship arrows, and composition/aggregation diamonds) 
while accurately reflecting the structure of our program.Balancing clarity, detail, and correctness took time,
but it helped solidify our understanding of the systemâ€™s architecture.
