# FileSystem Watcher Project

## Iteration 4
This week I focused on building out the backend classes that support the GUI layer in C#. I implemented the MainWindow.xaml.cs and DatabaseManager.cs classes by keeping everything consistent with the structure and naming used in FileWatcherViewModel. I haven’t started the actual GUI layout yet, but I laid the foundation for how the view will interact with the logic. Most of my time was spent reviewing Microsoft’s open-source documentation to ensure everything is structured cleanly and follows best practices. Tairan ran into issues while working on the export and email service integration. His code disappeared after he tried pushing to the dev branch through the command line. This blocked progress on his side and we couldn’t fully test the export flow yet. We’ll revisit that next sprint and make sure version control is handled more carefully moving forward.
