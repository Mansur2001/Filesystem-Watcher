# FileSystem Watcher Project

## Iteration 1

This week, we encountered several challenges while working on our coding tasks and the filesystem project. Debugging in C was time-consuming, especially as we dealt with compilation errors, memory issues, and Makefile configuration for multiple main() functions. Managing file permissions and understanding build dependencies also slowed us down, but we gradually worked through them step by step; we worked on the SRS (Software Requirements Specification) document, which required us to carefully define the system's functional and nonfunctional requirements. This was a bit overwhelming at first, as it forced us to think deeply about how our design decisions would translate into code. Creating the UML diagrams was another hurdle becausse we had to make sure that the designing and format were accurate.We followed proper notation (like visibility markers, relationship arrows, and composition/aggregation diamonds) while accurately reflecting the structure of our program. Balancing clarity, detail, and correctness took time, but it helped solidify our understanding of the systemâ€™s architecture.
